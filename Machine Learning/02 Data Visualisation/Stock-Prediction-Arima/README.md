    This project will be useful for investors to invest in the stock market based on the various factors. The project’s target is to create a program that analyses previous stock data of companies. This also includes identifying factors affecting the share market. Also to generate the patterns from large data sets of data of the stock market and to predict an approximate value of share price.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Analysing the stock market and reducing the complexity of acquiring knowledge by visualisation of stocks and prediction of stock prices. Also, due to coronavirus, there has been a lot of decrease in the prices of stock. This is something additional that we’ve added in our project.<br><br>
This project is based on technical analysis, visualization, and prediction by using Time Series Analysis. We are looking at data from the stock market, particularly some giant technology stocks such as APPLE and GOOGLE. We used pandas to get stock information, visualized different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analysing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The main feature of this project is to generate an approximate forecasting output and create a general idea of future values based on the previous data by generating a pattern. The scope of this project does not exceed more than a generalized suggestion tool. The time series analysis will be the best tool for forecasting the trend or even future. The trend chart will provide adequate guidance for the investor.
