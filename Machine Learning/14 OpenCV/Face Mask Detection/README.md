# Face-mask-Detection

- This is a Real-Time Face Mask Detector with Python, OpenCV, and Keras.
- Basically, a Machine Learning project for detecting face mask using sufficient testing and training datasets.
- I have used Jupyter Notebook to write the testing and training scripts in Python

### Steps:
1. Install Jupyter Notebook
-  (Make a file train.py to write the code for training the neural network on our dataset
2. Import all the Libraries and Modules required.
3. Build convlutional Neural Network with following parts: Conv and MaxPool layers to extract features from the dataset.
4. Also, add Flatten and Dropout layer to convert the data in 1D and ensure overfitting.
5. Image Generation/Augmentation
6. Initaialize a call-back as checkpoint
7. Train the Model
8. Now, test the results of face mask detector model using OpenCV.
9. Run the project and observe the model performance: 
        
        
        python3 test.py
