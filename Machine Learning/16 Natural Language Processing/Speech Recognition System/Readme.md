*Speech Recognition*
This projects involves Speech Recognition using gogle libraries. Here i used google speech to text library, google text to speech library and google translate library and also wikipedia library for fetching useful information through our voice.

Note : You can change the default translator to any other language to passing from_lang and to_lang arguments in the translate function. For checking all supported languages you can type $ gtts-cli --all
