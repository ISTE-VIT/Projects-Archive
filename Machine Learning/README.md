## What is Machine Learning?  🧠

Machine learning (ML) is the study and the use of computer algorithms that can improve itself through experience and by the use of data. It is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves computers discovering how they can perform various tasks. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand. For the advanced tasks, it can be challenging to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having programmers specify every needed step.

## Deployment


###  Deployment using Microsoft Azure ☁️

#### Setup: ⚙️
* Avail your Github Student Pack. 
* Sign in / Sign up on Azure.  
* In VS Code download the Azure Extension.

<p align="center">

</p>

* Now sign into Azure from VS Code.
* Then open this tab
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/jh3cYx5/pic2.png" width=500px>
</p>

* If it asks you to create a new workspace, click on yes and create a new workspace.

* Click on the plus icon to create a new app service 



#### Creating an App Service:👨‍🍳

 1. Enter a globally unique name for your app service.
<p align="center">

</p>



#### Deploying the API: 🚀
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/p0Bv9Zg/pic6.png" width=500px>
</p>

* Right-click on the app service you created.
* Click on Deploy to the Web App.
* Check the deployment logs if there are any errors.
* After the API gets deployed test it using Postman (or any other API testing application).
* Make a collection on postman for the required routes.
* Now create an Issue and send a Pull Request(attach the postman collection).


### Hurrah! You just made your first Pull request ! 🎉
