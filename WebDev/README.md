## What is WebDev ?  🧠

Web development encompasses lots of skills, technologies and techniques. Basically, web development is the work that goes into creating websites for the internet. Web development can entail anything from a simple static web page, to full fledged web apps, e-commerce sites and social networks.

## What do Front-End Web Developers Do?
Front-end developers are the ones that create the part of a website that you see. They use HTML, CSS and usually JavaScript to create the front-end. They might also utilize a framework like React, Vue or Angular, depending on their personal skillset and the demands of the client.

## What do Back-End Web Developers Do?
Back-end developers are responsible for making sure that the data the website or web app needs is available for the front-end to present. This involves setting up servers, creating API's and making sure that the product can handle the amount of users it wants to serve. This gets more complex the more users access a site.
